Using sound measurements collected from 67 sites across diverse land-use and traffic environments in 2023, we applied a land-use regression (LUR) framework to  predict daily (LAeq24h), daytime (Lday), and nighttime (Lnight) sound levels across Dhaka city. We then combined modeled surfaces with gridded population and socioeconomic data to estimate population exposures and assess inequality in environmental noise burdens. This study provides new empirical evidence on urban soundscapes in a rapidly growing South Asian megacity and illustrates how spatial modeling can inform equitable, data-driven urban noise management in resource-limited settings. This repo contains scripts covering i) data cleaning and modification, ii) building the land-use regression (LUR) model,  and iii) estimating the population exposure and assess inequality in environmental noise burdens by SES.
